My research interests are related with the application of new and clean technologies to obtain energy, especially focused on renewable energy and the power electronics technologies which enables a more efficient and effective use. In this aspect, I am especially interested in distributed generation and microgrids, new and advanced control techniques for them, and the effects of climate change on the availability patterns for solar and wind resources. I love listening to good music, reading poetry and very good novels, and riding my bike.

Currently, I am finishing my PhD. and working in the Anillo Project ANID/ATE220023 RESSET-Chile, “Centre for Multidisciplinary Research on Smart and Sustainable Energy Technologies for Sub-Antarctic Regions under Climate Crisis”.
