My interest is to investigate how plants survive, grow and reproduce under environmental contexts characterized by resource scarcity (nutrients/water) and incidence of stress factors [some of natural origin (e.g. high temperatures, UVb radiation, ozone) and others of anthropogenic origin (e.g. pesticides)]. In this sense, we are specifically interested in understanding what are the functions that symbiotic microorganisms fulfill in the ability of plants to accommodate/adapt to the abiotic environment and, in particular, in the defense against biotic threats (herbivores and pathogens).
