Biotechnology Engineer from Universidad Andrés Bello. He is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Biotechnology at the same university. I have experience in water, soil and air sampling, as well as microbiological analysis of water and the use of bioinformatics tools. I am currently working on my thesis called "Functional genomic dynamics of the microbial communities of the Comau Fjord" under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Castro and under the Regular Fondecyt project 1200834 also directed by Dr. Castro.
