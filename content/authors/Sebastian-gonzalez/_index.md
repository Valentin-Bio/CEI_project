I am a research assistant. My main research interest is in the use of biotechnological and molecular  tools on plants.
I have an extensive research experience in plant sciences, where I have worked in a number of projects, including:
- plant reproductive development, with special attention to flower induction and pollen development in grapevine
- the generation of tolerance to water deficit in plants of agricultural importance through the study of abiotic stress related genes.
My current work focuses on the evaluation of herbivory response genes in plant of <i>Lolium multiflorum</i> and the influence that a symbiotic microorganism may have on this. I am also working on the evaluation of the expression of the symbiont's own genes and their effect on the performance of the plant.
