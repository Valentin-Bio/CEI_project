My research interests are framed in landscape genetics, evolutionary ecology, phenotypic plasticity and plant-plant or plant-animal interactions. I seek to identify the most relevant processes and factors in ecological dynamics for their subsequent strategic application in restoration, productive management and conservation of ecosystems.
