PhD candidate in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. Biochemist by profession. My project is focused on identifying taxonomic and functional variations of microbiological communities of the Comau Fjord in the face of disturbances in the environment with a focus on rare taxa. My previous experience has been working with cellular mechanisms against regenerative processes in Danio rerio and comparative bioinformatic analysis of the genome and metabolism of Austrolebias charrua, a project developed at the Center for Genome Regulation.
