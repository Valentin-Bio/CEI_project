I have worked designing and programming protein-ligand interaction analysis pipelines, approaching the subject from a structural and atomic approach; using machine learning techniques. Currently, my line of research is focused on studying the interaction of Fragaria x ananassa and Penicillium chrysogenum under different levels of drought.
