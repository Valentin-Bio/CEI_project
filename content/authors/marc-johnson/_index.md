Director of the <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cue/">Centre for Urban Environments (CUE) </a>.

Prof. Johnson's EvoEco Lab addresses diverse questions in evolutionary ecology by merging techniques from genetics, evolution, ecology and chemistry. Although his lab's interests are broad, all aspects of research in the lab seek to understand the dynamic interplay between the evolution and ecology of species interactions, particularly as it relates to plant-animal interactions.
