My current research involves three main themes: (1) ecological and evolutionary implications of genetic variation, species richness and functional diversity of plants and associated micro-fungi (incl. mycorrhizae, endophytes and pathogens) and herbivores, (2) climate change -driven speciesâ€™ range shifts, and (3) new solutions to circumvent the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides in man-made environments.
