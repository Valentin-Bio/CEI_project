abstract: Plants are challenged by biotic and abiotic stress factors and the incidence
  of one can increase or decrease resistance to another. These relations can also
  occur transgenerationally. For instance, progeny plants whose mothers experienced
  herbivory can be more resistant to herbivores. Certain fungal endophytes that are
  vertically transmitted endow plants with alkaloids and resistance to herbivores.
  However, endophyte-symbiotic plants exposed to the oxidative agent ozone became
  susceptible to aphids. Here, we explored whether this effect persists transgenerationally.
  We exposed Lolium multiflorum plants with and without fungal endophyte Epichloë
  occultans to ozone (120 or 0 ppb), and then, challenged the progeny with aphids
  (Rhopalosiphum padi). The endophyte was the main factor determining the resistance
  to aphids, but its importance diminished in plants with ozone history. This negative
  ozone effect on the endophyte-mediated resistance was apparent on aphid individual
  weights. Phenolic compounds in seeds were increased by the symbiosis and diminished
  by the ozone. The endophyte effect on phenolics vanished in progeny plants while
  the negative ozone effect persisted. Independently of ozone, the symbiosis increased
  the plant biomass (≈24%). Although ozone can diminish the importance of endophyte
  symbiosis for plant resistance to herbivores, it would be compensated by host growth
  stimulation.
