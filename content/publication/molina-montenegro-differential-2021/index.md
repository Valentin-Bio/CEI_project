abstract: Solar eclipses represent a natural and unexpected event for plants that
  can potentially affect photosynthetic performance at the individual level. This
  effect, however, has seldom been evaluated. Here, we measured the impact of a total
  solar eclipse on the photosynthetic rate of different tree species—located in the
  Bosque Fray Jorge National Park, Chile—with varying degrees of shade tolerance.
  Specifically, we assessed whether the rapid and progressive light limitation facilitated
  by a solar eclipse would negatively impact the photosynthetic responses of these
  tree species and whether their photosynthetic performance would have a greater decrease
  when the percentage of eclipse shadow was higher, particularly in the less shade-tolerant
  species. To accomplish this, we compared daily changes in the photosynthetic rates
  of three tree species during a control (non-eclipse) vs. an eclipse day that occurred
  on 2 July 2019. Overall, tree species showed differences between a non-eclipse and
  eclipse day in the daily dynamics of their photosynthetic performance, with this
  trend being most evident at the peak of the solar eclipse. Additionally, each species
  showed a different pattern of de-epoxidation in accordance with its degree of shade
  tolerance. Our results suggest that solar eclipses negatively affect the photosynthesis
  of the studied Chilean tree species, which may be related to energy dissipation
  capacity via the de-epoxidation of xanthophyll pigments. This effect was more evident
  in shade-intolerant species, indicating that eclipses can present different consequences
  for the overall performance of various plant species.
