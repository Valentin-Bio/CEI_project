abstract: Abstract  Background Little is known about the global distribution and environmental
  drivers of key microbial functional traits such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).
  Soils are one of Earth’s largest reservoirs of ARGs, which are integral for soil
  microbial competition, and have potential implications for plant and human health.
  Yet, their diversity and global patterns remain poorly described. Here, we analyzed
  285 ARGs in soils from 1012 sites across all continents and created the first global
  atlas with the distributions of topsoil ARGs.   Results We show that ARGs peaked
  in high latitude cold and boreal forests. Climatic seasonality and mobile genetic
  elements, associated with the transmission of antibiotic resistance, were also key
  drivers of their global distribution. Dominant ARGs were mainly related to multidrug
  resistance genes and efflux pump machineries. We further pinpointed the global hotspots
  of the diversity and proportions of soil ARGs.   Conclusions Together, our work
  provides the foundation for a better understanding of the ecology and global distribution
  of the environmental soil antibiotic resistome.
