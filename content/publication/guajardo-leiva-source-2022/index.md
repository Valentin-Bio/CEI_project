abstract: Rhizosphere microbial communities exert critical roles in plant health,
  nutrient cycling, and soil fertility. Despite the essential functions conferred
  by microbes, the source and acquisition of the rhizosphere are not entirely clear.
  Therefore, we investigated microbial community diversity and potential source using
  the only two native Antarctic plants, Deschampsia antarctica (Da) and Colobanthus
  quitensis (Cq), as models. We interrogated rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes
  at six locations in the Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, both individual
  plant species and their association (Da.Cq). Our results show that host plant species
  influenced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere.
  Here, the Da rhizosphere showed the lowest richness and diversity of bacteria compared
  to Cq and Da.Cq rhizospheres. In contrast, for rhizosphere fungal communities, plant
  species only influenced diversity, whereas the rhizosphere of Da exhibited higher
  fungal diversity than the Cq rhizosphere. Also, we found that environmental geographic
  pressures (i.e., sampling site, latitude, and altitude) and, to a lesser extent,
  biotic factors (i.e., plant species) determined the species turnover between microbial
  communities. Moreover, our analysis shows that the sources of the bacterial communities
  in the rhizosphere were local soils that contributed to homogenizing the community
  composition of the different plant species growing in the same sampling site. In
  contrast, the sources of rhizosphere fungi were local (for Da and Da.Cq) and distant
  soils (for Cq). Here, the host plant species have a specific effect in acquiring
  fungal communities to the rhizosphere. However, the contribution of unknown sources
  to the fungal rhizosphere (especially in Da and Da.Cq) indicates the existence of
  relevant stochastic processes in acquiring these microbes. Our study shows that
  rhizosphere microbial communities differ in their composition and diversity. These
  differences are explained mainly by the microbial composition of the soils that
  harbor them, acting together with plant species-specific effects. Both plant species
  acquire bacteria from local soils to form part of their rhizosphere. Seemingly,
  the acquisition process is more complex for fungi. We identified a significant contribution
  from unknown fungal sources due to stochastic processes and known sources from soils
  across the Byers Peninsula.
