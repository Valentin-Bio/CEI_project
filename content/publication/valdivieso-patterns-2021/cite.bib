 abstract = {As apex predators, pinnipeds are considered to be useful bioindicators
of marine and coastal environments. Endemic to a small archipelago in
the South Pacific, the Juan Fernandez fur seal (JFFS) is one of the
less-studied members of the pinniped family Otariidae. This study aimed
to characterize the fecal microbiome of the JFFS for the first time, in
order to establish a baseline for future studies of
host-microbial-environment interactions and monitoring programs. During
two consecutive reproductive seasons, 57 fecal samples were collected
from 7 different JFFS colonies within the Juan Fernandez Archipelago,
Chile. Bacterial composition and abundance were characterized by
sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The overall microbiome
composition was dominated by five phyla: Firmicutes (40 %),
Fusobacteria (30 %), Bacteroidetes (22 %), Proteobacteria (6 %) and
Actinobacteria (2 %). Alpha diversity was higher in Tierras Blancas.
However, location was not found to be a dominant driver of microbial
composition. Interestingly, the strongest signal in the data was a
negative association between the genera Peptoclostridium and
Fusobacterium, which explained 29.7 % of the total microbial
composition variability between samples. The genus Peptoclostridium has
not been reported in other pinniped studies and its role here is
unclear, with interpretation challenging due to a lack of information
regarding microbiome functionality in marine mammals. As a first insight
into the JFFS fecal microbiome, these results contribute towards our
understanding of the natural microbial diversity and composition in
free-ranging pinnipeds.},
