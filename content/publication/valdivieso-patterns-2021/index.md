abstract: 'As apex predators, pinnipeds are considered to be useful bioindicators
  of marine and coastal environments. Endemic to a small archipelago in the South
  Pacific, the Juan Fernandez fur seal (JFFS) is one of the less-studied members of
  the pinniped family Otariidae. This study aimed to characterize the fecal microbiome
  of the JFFS for the first time, in order to establish a baseline for future studies
  of host-microbial-environment interactions and monitoring programs. During two consecutive
  reproductive seasons, 57 fecal samples were collected from 7 different JFFS colonies
  within the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile. Bacterial composition and abundance
  were characterized by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The overall
  microbiome composition was dominated by five phyla: Firmicutes (40 %), Fusobacteria
  (30 %), Bacteroidetes (22 %), Proteobacteria (6 %) and Actinobacteria (2 %). Alpha
  diversity was higher in Tierras Blancas. However, location was not found to be a
  dominant driver of microbial composition. Interestingly, the strongest signal in
  the data was a negative association between the genera Peptoclostridium and Fusobacterium,
  which explained 29.7 % of the total microbial composition variability between samples.
  The genus Peptoclostridium has not been reported in other pinniped studies and its
  role here is unclear, with interpretation challenging due to a lack of information
  regarding microbiome functionality in marine mammals. As a first insight into the
  JFFS fecal microbiome, these results contribute towards our understanding of the
  natural microbial diversity and composition in free-ranging pinnipeds.'
