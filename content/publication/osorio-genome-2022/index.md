abstract: The genome of the marine alga Ulva compressa was assembled using long and
  short reads. The genome assembly was 80.8 Mb in size and encoded 19,207 protein-coding
  genes. Several genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and a few genes encoding enzymes
  that synthesize ascorbate and glutathione were identified, showing similarity to
  plant and bacterial enzymes. Additionally, several genes encoding signal transduction
  protein kinases, such as MAPKs, CDPKS, CBLPKs, and CaMKs, were also detected, showing
  similarity to plants, green microalgae, and bacterial proteins. Regulatory transcription
  factors, such as ethylene- and ABA-responsive factors, MYB, WRKY, and HSTF, were
  also present and showed similarity to plant and green microalgae transcription factors.
  Genes encoding enzymes that synthesize ACC and ABA-aldehyde were also identified,
  but oxidases that synthesize ethylene and ABA, as well as enzymes that synthesize
  other plant hormones, were absent. Interestingly, genes involved in plant cell wall
  synthesis and proteins related to animal extracellular matrix were also detected.
  Genes encoding cyclins and CDKs were also found, and CDKs showed similarity to animal
  and fungal CDKs. Few genes encoding voltage-dependent calcium channels and ionotropic
  glutamate receptors were identified as showing similarity to animal channels. Genes
  encoding Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels were not identified, even though
  TRPs have been experimentally detected, indicating that the genome is not yet complete.
  Thus, protein-coding genes present in the genome of U. compressa showed similarity
  to plant and green microalgae, but also to animal, bacterial, and fungal genes.
