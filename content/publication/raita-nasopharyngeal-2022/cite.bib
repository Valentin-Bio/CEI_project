Bronchiolitis is not only the leading cause of hospitalisation in US infants but also a major risk factor for asthma development. Growing evidence supports clinical heterogeneity within bronchiolitis. Our objectives were to identify metatranscriptome profiles of infant bronchiolitis, and to examine their relationship with the host transcriptome and subsequent asthma development.


Methods
As part of a multicentre prospective cohort study of infants (age \textless1 year) hospitalised for bronchiolitis, we integrated virus and nasopharyngeal metatranscriptome (species-level taxonomy and function) data measured at hospitalisation. We applied network-based clustering approaches to identify metatranscriptome profiles. We then examined their association with the host transcriptome at hospitalisation and risk for developing asthma.


Results

We identified five metatranscriptome profiles of bronchiolitis (n=244): profile A: virus
RSV
microbiome
commensals
; profile B: virus
RSV/RV-A
microbiome

H.influenzae

; profile C: virus
RSV
microbiome

S.pneumoniae

; profile D: virus
RSV
microbiome

M.nonliquefaciens

; and profile E: virus
RSV/RV-C
microbiome

M.catarrhalis

. Compared with profile A, profile B infants were characterised by a high proportion of eczema,
Haemophilus influenzae
abundance and enriched virulence related to antibiotic resistance. These profile B infants also had upregulated T-helper 17 and downregulated type I interferon pathways (false discovery rate (FDR) \textless0.005), and significantly higher risk for developing asthma (17.9%
versus
38.9%; adjusted OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.11–7.26). Likewise, profile C infants were characterised by a high proportion of parental asthma,
Streptococcus pneumoniae
dominance, and enriched glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism of the microbiome. These profile C infants had an upregulated RAGE signalling pathway (FDR \textless0.005) and higher risk of asthma (17.9%
versus
35.6%; adjusted OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.10–5.87).



Conclusions
Metatranscriptome and clustering analysis identified biologically distinct metatranscriptome profiles that have differential risks of asthma.},
