abstract: 'Background Bronchiolitis is not only the leading cause of hospitalisation
  in US infants but also a major risk factor for asthma development. Growing evidence
  supports clinical heterogeneity within bronchiolitis. Our objectives were to identify
  metatranscriptome profiles of infant bronchiolitis, and to examine their relationship
  with the host transcriptome and subsequent asthma development.   Methods As part
  of a multicentre prospective cohort study of infants (age textless1 year) hospitalised
  for bronchiolitis, we integrated virus and nasopharyngeal metatranscriptome (species-level
  taxonomy and function) data measured at hospitalisation. We applied network-based
  clustering approaches to identify metatranscriptome profiles. We then examined their
  association with the host transcriptome at hospitalisation and risk for developing
  asthma.   Results  We identified five metatranscriptome profiles of bronchiolitis
  (n=244): profile A: virus RSV microbiome commensals ; profile B: virus RSV/RV-A
  microbiome  H.influenzae  ; profile C: virus RSV microbiome  S.pneumoniae  ; profile
  D: virus RSV microbiome  M.nonliquefaciens  ; and profile E: virus RSV/RV-C microbiome  M.catarrhalis  .
  Compared with profile A, profile B infants were characterised by a high proportion
  of eczema, Haemophilus influenzae abundance and enriched virulence related to antibiotic
  resistance. These profile B infants also had upregulated T-helper 17 and downregulated
  type I interferon pathways (false discovery rate (FDR) textless0.005), and significantly
  higher risk for developing asthma (17.9% versus 38.9%; adjusted OR 2.81, 95% CI
  1.11–7.26). Likewise, profile C infants were characterised by a high proportion
  of parental asthma, Streptococcus pneumoniae dominance, and enriched glycerolipid
  and glycerophospholipid metabolism of the microbiome. These profile C infants had
  an upregulated RAGE signalling pathway (FDR textless0.005) and higher risk of asthma
  (17.9% versus 35.6%; adjusted OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.10–5.87).    Conclusions Metatranscriptome
  and clustering analysis identified biologically distinct metatranscriptome profiles
  that have differential risks of asthma.'
