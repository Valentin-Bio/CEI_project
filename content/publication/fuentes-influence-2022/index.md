abstract: 'The extreme environmental conditions and lack of water on the soil surface
  in hyperarid deserts hamper microbial life, allowing only highly specialized microbial
  communities to the establish colonies and survive. Until now, the microbial communities
  that inhabit or have inhabited soils of hyperarid environments at greater depths
  have been poorly studied. We analyzed for the first time the variation in microbial
  communities down to a depth of 3.4 m in one of the driest places of the world, the
  hyperarid Yungay region in the Atacama Desert, and we related it to changes in soil
  physico-chemical characteristics. We found that the moisture content changed from
  2 to 11% with depth and enabled the differentiation of three depth intervals: (i)
  surface zone A (0–60 cm), (ii) intermediate zone B (60–220 cm), and (iii) deep zone
  C (220–340 cm). Each zone showed further specific physicochemical and mineralogical
  features. Likewise, some bacterial phyla were unique in each zone, i.e., members
  of the taxa Deinococcota , Halobacterota , and Latescibacterota in zone A; Crenarchaeota
  , Fusobacteriota , and Deltaproteobacterium Sva0485 in zone B; and Fervidibacteria
  and Campilobacterota in zone C, which indicates taxon-specific preferences in deep
  soil habitats. Differences in the microbiota between the zones were rather abrupt,
  which is concomitant with abrupt changes in the physical-chemical parameters. Overall,
  moisture content, total carbon (TC), pH, and electric conductivity (EC) were most
  predictive of microbial richness and diversity, while total sulfur (TS) and total
  phosphorous (TP) contents were additionally predictive of community composition.
  We also found statistically significant associations between taxa and soil properties,
  most of which involved moisture and TC contents. Our findings show that under-explored
  habitats for microbial survival and existence may prevail at greater soil depths
  near water or within water-bearing layers, a valuable substantiation also for the
  ongoing search for biosignatures on other planets, such as Mars.'
