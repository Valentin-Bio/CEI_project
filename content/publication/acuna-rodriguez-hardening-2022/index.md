abstract: Harsh environmental conditions derived from current climate change trends
  are among the main challenges for agricultural production worldwide. In the Mediterranean
  climatic region of central Chile, sudden occurrence of spring cold temperatures
  in combination with water shortage for irrigation (drought) constitutes a major
  limitation to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) plantations, as flowering
  and fruiting stages are highly sensitive. Hardening crops may be achievable by boosting
  beneficial interactions of plants with microorganisms. Inoculation with symbiotic
  fungi isolated from plants adapted to extreme environments could be a good strategy,
  if they are able to maintain functional roles with non-original hosts. Here, we
  evaluated the effect of two Antarctic fungal endophytes (AFE), Penicillium rubens
  and P. bialowienzense, on the tolerance of V. corymbosum plants to cold events in
  combination with drought under controlled conditions. Inoculated and uninoculated
  plants were exposed for a month to one event of a cold temperature (2 °C/8 h) per
  week with or without drought and were evaluated in physiological, biochemical, and
  molecular variables. A complementary set of plants was kept under the same environmental
  conditions for two additional months to evaluate survival as well as fruit weight
  and size. There was an overall positive effect of AFE on plant performance in both
  environmental conditions. Endophyte-inoculated plants exhibited higher gene expression
  of the Late Embryogenesis Abundant protein (LEA1), higher photochemical efficiency
  (Fv/Fm), and low oxidative stress (TBARS) than uninoculated counterparts. On the
  other hand, plant survival was positively affected by the presence of fungal endophytes.
  Similarly, fruit diameter and fruit fresh weight were improved by fungal inoculation,
  being this difference higher under well-watered condition. Inoculating plants with
  fungal endophytes isolated from extreme environments represents a promising alternative
  for hardening crops. This is especially relevant nowadays since agriculture is confronting
  great environmental uncertainties and difficulties which could became worse in the
  near future due to climate change.
