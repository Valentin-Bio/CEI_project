abstract: Salmonella spp. is a relevant foodborne pathogen with worldwide distribution.
  To mitigate Salmonella infections, bacteriophages represent an alternative to antimicrobials
  and chemicals in food animals and food in general. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses
  that infect bacteria, which interact constantly with their host. Importantly, the
  study of these interactions is crucial for the use of phages as a mitigation strategy.
  In this study, experimental coevolution of Salmonella Enteritidis ( S . Enteritidis)
  and a lytic phage was conducted in tryptic soy broth for 21 days. Transfer to fresh
  media was conducted daily and every 24 hours, 2 mL of the sample was collected to
  quantify Salmonella OD 600 and phage titter. Additionally, time-shift experiments
  were conducted on 20 colonies selected on days 1, 12, and 21 to evaluate the evolution
  of resistance to past (day 1), present (day 12), and future (day 21) phage populations.
  The behavior of the dynamics was modeled and simulated with mathematical mass-action
  models. Bacteria and phage from days 1 and 21 were sequenced to determine the emergence
  of mutations. We found that S . Enteritidis grew for 21 days in the presence and
  absence of the phage and developed resistance to the phage from day 1. Also, the
  phage was also able to survive in the media for 21 days, however, the phage titer
  decreased in approx. 3 logs PFU/mL. The stability of the lytic phage population
  was consistent with the leaky resistance model. The time-shift experiments showed
  resistance to phages from day 1 of at least 85% to the past, present, and future
  phages. Sequencing of S . Enteritidis showed mutations in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide
  biosynthesis genes rfbP and rfbN at day 21. The phage showed mutations in the tail
  phage proteins responsible for recognizing the cell surface receptors. These results
  suggest that interactions between bacteria and phage in a rich resource media generate
  a rapid resistance to the infective phage but a fraction of the population remains
  susceptible. Interactions between Salmonella and lytic phages are an important component
  for the rational use of phages to control this important foodborne pathogen.
