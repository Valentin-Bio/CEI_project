abstract: Persistence and ubiquity of vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes
  in grass populations is puzzling because infected plants do not consistently exhibit
  increased fitness. Using an annual grass population model, we show that the problems
  for matching endophyte infection and mutualism are likely to arise from difficulties
  in detecting small mutualistic effects, variability in endophyte transmission efficiency
  and an apparent prevalence of non-equilibrium in the dynamics of infection. Although
  endophytes would ultimately persist only if the infection confers some fitness increase
  to the host plants, such an increase can be very small, as long as the transmission
  efficiency is sufficiently high. In addition, imperfect transmission limits effectively
  the equilibrium infection level if the infected plants exhibit small or large reproductive
  advantage. Under frequent natural conditions, the equilibrium infection level is
  very sensitive to small changes in transmission efficiency and host reproductive
  advantage, while convergence to such an equilibrium is slow. As a consequence, seed
  immigration and environmental fluctuation are likely to keep local infection levels
  away from equilibrium. Transient dynamics analysis suggests that, when driven by
  environmental fluctuation, infection frequency increases would often be larger than
  decreases. By contrast, when due to immigration, overrepresentation of infected
  individuals tends to vanish faster than equivalent overrepresentation of non-infected
  individuals.
