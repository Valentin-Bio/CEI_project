abstract: 'Abstract. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are synthetic compounds
  that were intentionally produced in large quantities and have been distributed in
  the global environment, originating a threat due to their persistence, bioaccumulative
  potential and toxicity. POPs reach the Antarctic continent through long-range atmospheric
  transport. In these areas low temperatures play a significant role in the environmental
  fate of POPs, retaining them for a long-time due to cold trapping by diffusion and
  wet deposition, acting as net sink for many POPs. However, in the current context
  of climate change, remobilization of POPs trapped for decades in water, ice, and
  soil, is happening. Therefore, continuous monitoring of POPs in polar air is necessary
  to assess whether there is a recent re-release of historical pollutants back to
  the environment. We reviewed the scientific literature on atmospheric levels of
  several POPs families (polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs, hexachlorobenzene HCB, hexachlorocyclohexanes
  HCHs, and DDT) from 1988 to 2021. We estimated the atmospheric half-life using characteristic
  decreasing times (TD). We observed that HCB levels in the Antarctic atmosphere were
  higher than the other target OCs, but HCB also displayed higher fluctuations and
  did not show a significant decrease over time. Conversely, the atmospheric levels
  of HCHs, and some,DDTs, and PCBs have decreased significantly. The estimated atmospheric
  half-lives for POPs decreased in the following order: 4,4’ DDE (13.5 years) textgreater
  4,4’ DDD (12.8 years) textgreater 4,4’ DDT (7.4 years) textgreater 2,4’ DDE (6.4
  years) textgreater 2,4’ DDT (6.3 years) textgreater α-HCH (6 years) textgreater
  HCB (6 years) textgreater γ-HCH (4.2 years), while for PCB congeners they decreased
  in the following order: PCB 153 (7.6 years) textgreater PCB 138 (6.5 years) textgreater
  PCB 101 (4.7 years) textgreater PCB 180 (4.6 years) textgreater PCB 28 (4 years)
  textgreater PCB 52 (3.7 years) textgreater PCB 118 (3.6 years). For HCH isomers
  and PCBs, the Stockholm Convention ban on POPs did have an impact on decreasing
  their levels during the last decades. Nevertheless, their ubiquity in the Antarctic
  atmosphere shows the problematic issues related to highly persistent synthetic chemicals.'
