abstract: In Argentinean crop fields, weed control is mainly achieved by intense use
  of glyphosate as a nonselective and/or selective herbicide. Glyphosate use is very
  high as more than 95% of the 16 million ha soybean crop consists of glyphosate-resistant
  cultivars, always treated with this herbicide. From initial success, inconsistent
  glyphosate control of Johnsongrass, an invading C4 perennial grass of soybean crops,
  has become evident to producers from northern Argentina over the last 3 yr. Prior
  to this, glyphosate provided good control. This study evaluated the nature of these
  recurrent glyphosate failures in Johnsongrass. Experiments conducted with Johnsongrass
  plants obtained from seed and rhizome phytomers collected from fields with intense
  glyphosate use history showed that these populations showed differential survival
  and biomass productivity when glyphosate treated than Johnsongrass plants obtained
  from similar propagules collected from field sites with no history of glyphosate
  use. This empirical evidence establishes that the Johnsongrass survival in glyphosate-treated
  transgenic soybean fields from northern Argentina is due to evolved glyphosate resistance.
