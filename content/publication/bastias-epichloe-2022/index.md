abstract: Seeds commonly harbour diverse bacterial communities that can enhance the
  fitness of future plants. The bacterial microbiota associated with mother plant’s
  foliar tissues is one of the main sources of bacteria for seeds. Therefore, any
  ecological factor influencing the mother plant’s microbiota may also affect the
  diversity of the seed’s bacterial community. Grasses form associations with beneficial
  vertically transmitted fungal endophytes of genus Epichloë . The interaction of
  plants with Epichloë endophytes and insect herbivores can influence the plant foliar
  microbiota. However, it is unknown whether these interactions (alone or in concert)
  can affect the assembly of bacterial communities in the produced seed. We subjected
  Lolium multiflorum plants with and without its common endophyte Epichloë occultans
  (E+, E-, respectively) to an herbivory treatment with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids
  and assessed the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities in the produced
  seed. The presence of Epichloë endophytes influenced the seed bacterial microbiota
  by increasing the diversity and affecting the composition of the communities. The
  relative abundances of the bacterial taxa were more similarly distributed in communities
  associated with E+ than E- seeds with the latter being dominated by just a few bacterial
  groups. Contrary to our expectations, seed bacterial communities were not affected
  by the aphid herbivory experienced by mother plants. We speculate that the enhanced
  seed/seedling performance documented for Epichloë -host associations may be explained,
  at least in part, by the Epichloë -mediated increment in the seed-bacterial diversity,
  and that this phenomenon may be applicable to other plant-endophyte associations.
