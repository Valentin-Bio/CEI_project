abstract: 'Colobanthus quitensis (Kunt) is one of the two vascular plant species present
  in Antarctica and develops under severe environmental conditions, being found in
  both pristine and human-threatened environments. We determined the Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn,
  Ni, Pb, and Zn levels in C. quitensis roots, leaves, and soils of origin using flame
  atomic absorption spectroscopy. In January 2017, we collected samples from four
  geographical zones on the longitudinal gradient along which C. quitensis is distributed,
  starting from Punta Arenas (PAR) at the extreme south of mainland Chile and moving
  southwards to the Antarctic territory from King George Island (KGI) to Hannah Point
  Peninsula (PHA) and finally Lagotellerie Island (LAT). We used certified reference
  material to validate the plant tissues and soil samples we collected. The highest
  concentrations of metals that we measured in the soils and in the C. quitensis roots
  and leaves were in samples we collected at the KGI station, the zone with the greatest
  human activity. The lowest concentrations we measured were at the LAT station, an
  island with little human intervention and scarce fauna. The mean concentrations
  of metals in the roots and leaves of C. quitensis followed a similar order at all
  sampling locations: Mn textgreater Zn textgreater Cu textgreater Ni textgreater
  Pb textgreater Cr textgreater Cd. In contrast, in soil, they followed the following
  order: Mn textgreater Zn textgreater Cu textgreater Cr textgreater Pb textgreater
  Ni textgreater Cd. The concentration levels obtained for the different metals in
  the soil and plants tissue samples in this region of Antarctica indicated that the
  area was non-polluted. However, the metallic trace element (MTE) concentrations
  may be at an early stage of contamination, as described in other areas of the Antarctic,
  being a new threat to this continent.'
