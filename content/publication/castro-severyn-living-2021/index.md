abstract: As microbial communities inhabiting extreme environments are fundamental
  for maintaining ecosystems, many studies concerning composition, functionality,
  and interactions have been carried out. However, much is still unknown. ,  ABSTRACT  Microbial
  communities inhabiting extreme environments such as Salar de Huasco (SH) in northern
  Chile are adapted to thrive while exposed to several abiotic pressures and the presence
  of toxic elements such as arsenic (As). Hence, we aimed to uncover the role of As
  in shaping bacterial composition, structure, and functional potential in five different
  sites in this altiplanic wetland using a shotgun metagenomic approach. The sites
  exhibit wide gradients of As (9 to 321 mg/kg), and our results showed highly diverse
  communities and a clear dominance exerted by the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes
  phyla. Functional potential analyses show broadly convergent patterns, contrasting
  with their great taxonomic variability. As-related metabolism, as well as other
  functional categories such as those related to the CH 4 and S cycles, differs among
  the five communities. Particularly, we found that the distribution and abundance
  of As-related genes increase as the As concentration rises. Approximately 75% of
  the detected genes for As metabolism belong to expulsion mechanisms; arsJ and arsP
  pumps are related to sites with higher As concentrations and are present almost
  exclusively in Proteobacteria . Furthermore, taxonomic diversity and functional
  potential are reflected in the 12 reconstructed high-quality metagenome assembled
  genomes (MAGs) belonging to the Bacteroidetes (5), Proteobacteria (5), Cyanobacteria
  (1), and Gemmatimonadetes (1) phyla. We conclude that SH microbial communities are
  diverse and possess a broad genetic repertoire to thrive under extreme conditions,
  including increasing concentrations of highly toxic As. Finally, this environment
  represents a reservoir of unknown and undescribed microorganisms, with great metabolic
  versatility, which needs further study.   IMPORTANCE As microbial communities inhabiting
  extreme environments are fundamental for maintaining ecosystems, many studies concerning
  composition, functionality, and interactions have been carried out. However, much
  is still unknown. Here, we sampled microbial communities in the Salar de Huasco,
  an extreme environment subjected to several abiotic stresses (high UV radiation,
  salinity and arsenic; low pressure and temperatures). We found that although microbes
  are taxonomically diverse, functional potential seems to have an important degree
  of convergence, suggesting high levels of adaptation. Particularly, arsenic metabolism
  showed differences associated with increasing concentrations of the metalloid throughout
  the area, and it effectively exerts a significant pressure over these organisms.
  Thus, the significance of this research is that we describe highly specialized communities
  thriving in little-explored environments subjected to several pressures, considered
  analogous of early Earth and other planets, that have the potential for unraveling
  technologies to face the repercussions of climate change in many areas of interest.
