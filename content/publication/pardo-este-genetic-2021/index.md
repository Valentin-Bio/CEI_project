abstract: Salmonella comprises over 2500 serotypes and foodborne contamination associated
  with this pathogen remains an important health concern worldwide. During the last
  decade, a shift in serotype prevalence has occurred as traditionally less prevalent
  serotypes are increasing in frequency of infections, especially those related to
  poultry meat contamination. S. Infantis is one of the major emerging serotypes,
  and these strains commonly display antimicrobial resistance and can persist despite
  cleaning protocols. Thus, this work aimed to isolate S. Infantis strains from a
  poultry meat farm in Santiago, Chile and to characterize genetic variations present
  in them. We determined their genomic and phenotypic profiles at different points
  along the production line. The results indicate that the strains encompass 853 polymorphic
  sites (core-SNPs) with isolates differing from one another by 0–347 core SNPs, suggesting
  variation among them; however, we found discrete correlations with the source of
  the sample in the production line. Furthermore, the pan-genome was composed of 4854
  total gene clusters of which 2618 (53.9%) corresponds to the core-genome and only
  181 (3.7%) are unique genes (those present in one particular strain). This preliminary
  analysis will enrich the surveillance of Salmonella, yet further studies are required
  to assess their evolution and phylogeny.
