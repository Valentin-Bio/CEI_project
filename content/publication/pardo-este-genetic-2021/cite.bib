 abstract = {Salmonella comprises over 2500 serotypes and foodborne contamination associated with this pathogen remains an important health concern worldwide. During the last decade, a shift in serotype prevalence has occurred as traditionally less prevalent serotypes are increasing in frequency of infections, especially those related to poultry meat contamination. S. Infantis is one of the major emerging serotypes, and these strains commonly display antimicrobial resistance and can persist despite cleaning protocols. Thus, this work aimed to isolate S. Infantis strains from a poultry meat farm in Santiago, Chile and to characterize genetic variations present in them. We determined their genomic and phenotypic profiles at different points along the production line. The results indicate that the strains encompass 853 polymorphic sites (core-SNPs) with isolates differing from one another by 0–347 core SNPs, suggesting variation among them; however, we found discrete correlations with the source of the sample in the production line. Furthermore, the pan-genome was composed of 4854 total gene clusters of which 2618 (53.9%) corresponds to the core-genome and only 181 (3.7%) are unique genes (those present in one particular strain). This preliminary analysis will enrich the surveillance of Salmonella, yet further studies are required to assess their evolution and phylogeny.},
