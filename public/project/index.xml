Astroecology is a research field devoted to scientific study of the interactions of life with extreme environments even exoplanetary conditions. By applying theory, methods and technology from ecology, microbiology, molecular biology, and engineering, we aim to help solve major global challenges such as extreme climate change and space-research stuff. Astroecology is a rapidly developing field with a strong interdisciplinary aspect that holds many challenges and opportunities for scientists. Indeed, technological advances have made possible long space travels and even exoplanetary colonies in the future. Nevertheless, the success of these activities depends on our ability to produce edible plants in stressful conditions such as high radiation, extreme temperatures, and low oxygen levels. In fact, several beneficial microorganisms, such as those inhabiting extreme environments, have helped agriculture cope with those difficulties. Thus, extremophiles may be a putative tool to ensure plant growth under exoplanetary conditions. In addition, microgravity is other constraint imposed to crops in space travel, in this sense microorganisms from extreme environments would help to cope with this factor for many plants, due the switch-on of different biochemical pathways and molecular responses by part of these extremophiles. Thus, our main aims are devoted to assesses the ecological, biochemical, and molecular responses of extremophiles inhabiting from environments such as the Antarctica, High-Mountains or Atacama Desert exposed to exoplanetary conditions, to search and select microorganisms able to act as a key biotechnological tool for future space agriculture, and helping plants cope with harsh environmental conditions as those find at beyond of the Earth.

&lt;p&gt;The diversity and functional significance of microbial communities have become apparent in the last 20 years. Microbial and viral communities dominate nearly every habitat on Earth from the deep ocean subsurface to the mountain tops and everything in between. Microbes contribute to planetary-level processes such as element cycling and to other organisms’ homeostasis such as humans and other non-human animals and plants. While recent advances in microscopy, nucleic acid sequencing, and microbial culturing, are enabling researchers worldwide to study microbial communities in the most varied environments, we continue to learn more about processes and mechanisms that govern microbial communities, both at the community and the molecular level. Likewise, microbial ecology is maturing into a discipline concerned not only with describing patterns and inferring processes, but also with manipulating and designing microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the Center for Integrative Ecology, we approach microbial ecology at different levels of organization, from molecules, to populations, to communities, and traits. We focus on extreme environments from high latitudes or altitudes including Patagonian fjords and channels and desert environments such as Antarctica and the Atacama Desert in an effort to characterize and understand phylogenetic and functional diversity locally but with global impacts.  These extreme environments offer unparalleled opportunities to untangle microbial interactions and function. In Antarctica, for instance, we study origin, phylogeny and function of soil and rhizosphere microbes, including viruses. In this environment, only two vascular plants naturally occur, which turn this environment effectively in a natural laboratory for conducting microbial ecology. In the remote Patagonian fjords and channels, little is known about composition and diversity of microbial communities, let alone their functions and emerging properties such as resilience and resistance. And in the Atacama Desert, we know a great deal about microbial community composition and structure but much less about the functions microbes and viruses encode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this area of research, we attempt to answer questions including but not limited to interactions between different ecosystems, populating the branches of the microbial and viral tree of life, and understanding how viruses exert control of microbial communities in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some of the questions are: How do microbial communities migrate? What is the relative contribution of soil or the phyllosphere to migration? How migrating microbes are incorporated to their new habitat? What is the coding potential of dark matter microbes and viruses? What mechanisms viruses use to bottom-up control microbial communities? What are the environmental consequences of bottom-up control for microbial services to ecosystems?

      <title>Plant Ecology and Evolution in Agroecosystems</title>

Plants are the key as they produce most of the organic energy that sustain life and ecosystem processes on earth. This organic energy can be in live organisms or dead matter and sustain plant-based trophic food webs or detritus-based trophic webs. 
Human activities are changing the entire planet at an unprecedented rate - so there is no ecosystem out of their influence. This is more relevant under the existing compromise between producing food for a growing wealthy population settled in even bigger cities and nature conservation. 
Our interest is to investigate how plants survive, grow, and reproduce under environmental contexts characterized by the scarcity of resources (nutrients / water) and incidence of stress factors [some of natural origin (e.g., high temperatures, UV-B radiation, ozone) and others of anthropic origin (e.g., pesticides)]. In this regard, we are specifically interested in understanding what are the functions that symbiotic microorganisms fulfill in the ability of plants to accommodate / adapt to the abiotic environment and in particular, in defense against biotic threats (herbivores and pathogens). 
Never before, two big impulses lead our work and fall under the umbrella of the ecology and evolution in agroecosystems: (1) The genuine interest in understanding the drivers behind the organization of nature – from genes to ecosystems, and (2) The necessity to find solutions to the global challenges such as climate change and food security. Our research integrates plant physiology and microbiology with ecology and evolution (which involve plant interaction with biotic threats (herbivores and pathogens) and abiotic stress factors. We are a fundamental piece in the society - running research projects and forming young scientist that will be in charge of solving the coming environmental issues.
