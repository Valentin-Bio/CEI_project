Microbial and viral communities dominate nearly every habitat on Earth from the deep ocean subsurface to the mountain tops and everything in between. Microbes contribute to planetary-level processes such as element cycling and to other organisms’ homeostasis such as humans and other non-human animals and plants. While recent advances in microscopy, nucleic acid sequencing, and microbial culturing, are enabling researchers worldwide to study microbial communities in the most varied environments, we continue to learn more about processes and mechanisms that govern microbial communities, both at the community and the molecular level. Likewise, microbial ecology is maturing into a discipline concerned not only with describing patterns and inferring processes, but also with manipulating and designing microbiomes.\nIn the Center for Integrative Ecology, we approach microbial ecology at different levels of organization, from molecules, to populations, to communities, and traits. We focus on extreme environments from high latitudes or altitudes including Patagonian fjords and channels and desert environments such as Antarctica and the Atacama Desert in an effort to characterize and understand phylogenetic and functional diversity locally but with global impacts. These extreme environments offer unparalleled opportunities to untangle microbial interactions and function. In Antarctica, for instance, we study origin, phylogeny and function of soil and rhizosphere microbes, including viruses. In this environment, only two vascular plants naturally occur, which turn this environment effectively in a natural laboratory for conducting microbial ecology. In the remote Patagonian fjords and channels, little is known about composition and diversity of microbial communities, let alone their functions and emerging properties such as resilience and resistance. And in the Atacama Desert, we know a great deal about microbial community composition and structure but much less about the functions microbes and viruses encode. In this area of research, we attempt to answer questions including but not limited to interactions between different ecosystems, populating the branches of the microbial and viral tree of life, and understanding how viruses exert control of microbial communities in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some of the questions are: How do microbial communities migrate? What is the relative contribution of soil or the phyllosphere to migration? How migrating microbes are incorporated to their new habitat? What is the coding potential of dark matter microbes and viruses? What mechanisms viruses use to bottom-up control microbial communities? What are the environmental consequences of bottom-up control for microbial services to ecosystems?

This organic energy can be in live organisms or dead matter and sustain plant-based trophic food webs or detritus-based trophic webs. Human activities are changing the entire planet at an unprecedented rate - so there is no ecosystem out of their influence. This is more relevant under the existing compromise between producing food for a growing wealthy population settled in even bigger cities and nature conservation. Our interest is to investigate how plants survive, grow, and reproduce under environmental contexts characterized by the scarcity of resources (nutrients / water) and incidence of stress factors [some of natural origin (e.g., high temperatures, UV-B radiation, ozone) and others of anthropic origin (e.g., pesticides)]. In this regard, we are specifically interested in understanding what are the functions that symbiotic microorganisms fulfill in the ability of plants to accommodate / adapt to the abiotic environment and in particular, in defense against biotic threats (herbivores and pathogens). Never before, two big impulses lead our work and fall under the umbrella of the ecology and evolution in agroecosystems: (1) The genuine interest in understanding the drivers behind the organization of nature – from genes to ecosystems, and (2) The necessity to find solutions to the global challenges such as climate change and food security. Our research integrates plant physiology and microbiology with ecology and evolution (which involve plant interaction with biotic threats (herbivores and pathogens) and abiotic stress factors. We are a fundamental piece in the society - running research projects and forming young scientist that will be in charge of solving the coming environmental issues.

In the Mediterranean climatic region of central Chile, sudden occurrence of spring cold temperatures in combination with water shortage for irrigation (drought) constitutes a major limitation to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) plantations, as flowering and fruiting stages are highly sensitive. Hardening crops may be achievable by boosting beneficial interactions of plants with microorganisms. Inoculation with symbiotic fungi isolated from plants adapted to extreme environments could be a good strategy, if they are able to maintain functional roles with non-original hosts. Here, we evaluated the effect of two Antarctic fungal endophytes (AFE), Penicillium rubens and P. bialowienzense, on the tolerance of V. corymbosum plants to cold events in combination with drought under controlled conditions. Inoculated and uninoculated plants were exposed for a month to one event of a cold temperature (2 °C/8 h) per week with or without drought and were evaluated in physiological, biochemical, and molecular variables. A complementary set of plants was kept under the same environmental conditions for two additional months to evaluate survival as well as fruit weight and size. There was an overall positive effect of AFE on plant performance in both environmental conditions. Endophyte-inoculated plants exhibited higher gene expression of the Late Embryogenesis Abundant protein (LEA1), higher photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), and low oxidative stress (TBARS) than uninoculated counterparts. On the other hand, plant survival was positively affected by the presence of fungal endophytes. Similarly, fruit diameter and fruit fresh weight were improved by fungal inoculation, being this difference higher under well-watered condition. Inoculating plants with fungal endophytes isolated from extreme environments represents a promising alternative for hardening crops. This is especially relevant nowadays since agriculture is confronting great environmental uncertainties and difficulties which could became worse in the near future due to climate change.","tags":[],"title":"Hardening Blueberry Plants to Face Drought and Cold Events by the Application of Fungal Endophytes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Barrera","Ian S.

The effects of these BSC at the micro-site scale have been related to the development of diverse plant species that, otherwise, might be strongly limited by the harsh abiotic conditions found in environments with low water availability. Here, we describe for the first time the bacterial composition of BSCs found in the proximities of Admiralty Bay (Maritime Antarctica) through 16S metabarcoding. In addition, we evaluated their effect on soils (nutrient levels, enzymatic activity, and water retention), and on the fitness and performance of Colobanthus quitensis , one of the two native Antarctic vascular plants. This was achieved by comparing the photochemical performance, foliar nutrient, biomass, and reproductive investment between C. quitensis plants growing with or without the influence of BSC. Our results revealed a high diversity of prokaryotes present in these soil communities, although we found differences in terms of their abundances. We also found that the presence of BSCs is linked to a significant increase in soils’ water retention, nutrient levels, and enzymatic activity when comparing with control soils (without BSCs). In the case of C. quitensis , we found that measured ecophysiological performance parameters were significantly higher on plants growing in association with BSCs. Taken together, our results suggest that BSCs in Antarctic soils are playing a key role in various biochemical processes involved in soil development, while also having a positive effect on the accompanying vascular flora. Therefore, BSCs would be effectively acting as ecosystem engineers for the terrestrial Antarctic ecosystem.","tags":[],"title":"Biological Soil Crusts as Ecosystem Engineers in Antarctic Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bárbara Fuentes","Alessandra Choque","Francisco Gómez","Dr. Jaime Alarcón","Eduardo Castro-Nallar","Franko Arenas","Daniel Contreras","Ramona Mörchen","Wulf Amelung","Claudia Knief","Ghazal Moradi","Erwin Klumpp","Claudia P.

Until now, the microbial communities that inhabit or have inhabited soils of hyperarid environments at greater depths have been poorly studied. We analyzed for the first time the variation in microbial communities down to a depth of 3.4 m in one of the driest places of the world, the hyperarid Yungay region in the Atacama Desert, and we related it to changes in soil physico-chemical characteristics. We found that the moisture content changed from 2 to 11% with depth and enabled the differentiation of three depth intervals: (i) surface zone A (0–60 cm), (ii) intermediate zone B (60–220 cm), and (iii) deep zone C (220–340 cm). Each zone showed further specific physicochemical and mineralogical features. Likewise, some bacterial phyla were unique in each zone, i.e., members of the taxa Deinococcota , Halobacterota , and Latescibacterota in zone A; Crenarchaeota , Fusobacteriota , and Deltaproteobacterium Sva0485 in zone B; and Fervidibacteria and Campilobacterota in zone C, which indicates taxon-specific preferences in deep soil habitats. Differences in the microbiota between the zones were rather abrupt, which is concomitant with abrupt changes in the physical-chemical parameters. Overall, moisture content, total carbon (TC), pH, and electric conductivity (EC) were most predictive of microbial richness and diversity, while total sulfur (TS) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were additionally predictive of community composition. We also found statistically significant associations between taxa and soil properties, most of which involved moisture and TC contents. Our findings show that under-explored habitats for microbial survival and existence may prevail at greater soil depths near water or within water-bearing layers, a valuable substantiation also for the ongoing search for biosignatures on other planets, such as Mars.","tags":[],"title":"Influence of Physical-Chemical Soil Parameters on Microbiota Composition and Diversity in a Deep Hyperarid Core of the Atacama Desert","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Varas-Myrik","Francisco Sepúlveda-Espinoza","Alex Fajardo","Diego Alarcón","Óscar Toro-Núñez","Eduardo Castro-Nallar","Rodrigo Hasbún"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656891997,"objectID":"6fb815ad616a0f3b7bbbd42530293c30","permalink":"https://aesthetic-gecko-c65929.netlify.app/publication/varas-myrik-predicting-2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-03T23:59:11.705972Z","relpermalink":"/publication/varas-myrik-predicting-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Predicting climate change-related genetic offset for the endangered southern South American conifer Araucaria araucana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mailen A.
